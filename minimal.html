            <p>U.S. stocks already are having a rough October — two trading days in. Notice that, by this definition, they are unpredictable, so it’s false comfort to believe you can anticipate future black swans in time to reduce your portfolio risk and thereby sidestep a market crash.

(Bloomberg) -- The owner of a pipeline at the heart of California’s worst oil spill in almost 30 years is investigating the disaster site with a remotely controlled device and local authorities warned the cleanup may take weeks. That’s the Golden State’s largest such disaster since a 1994 earthquake split open a pipeline and poured about 4,500 barrels into the sea, according to a database compiled by the non-profit Public Media Group of Southern California. Amplify tumbled as much as 53% on Monday. Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek

            <p>Vanguard Mutual Funds vs. Vanguard ETFs: An Overview

Vanguard, one of the world's largest asset management firms with more than $7.2 trillion in assets under management as of January 31, 2021. Mutual fund shares price only once per day, at the end of the trading day, but may benefit from economies of scale. Moreover, for many of its mutual funds, Vanguard offers up to three classes of shares, Investor Shares, Admiral Shares, and Institutional Shares, each class offering progressively lower expense ratios, and thus better performance, in return for higher minimum investments. In general, ETFs may be more suitable than mutual funds for investors who seek lower minimum investment amounts and who want more control over transaction prices.</p>

That’s become the standard way to move things through the global economy for a reason: Packing goods into equally-sized metal boxes makes it easy to transfer them between trucks, trains, and ships, alleviating logistical headaches and keeping transportation costs low. But, thanks to the pandemic, container shipping is experiencing such severe price spikes and logistical delays that Coca-Cola has decided to ditch the system altogether for some of its cargo. “When you can’t get containers or space due to the current ocean freight crisis, then we had to think outside the box (or the container),” Smith wrote in his LinkedIn post, according to a trade publication, The LoadStar.</p>

If you retire before full retirement age and your income goes up instead of down for any reason—you sell off a high-value asset, you start a profitable business, or you earn a lot as a consultant or freelancer—then that could substantially impact what you get from Social Security, at least until you reach full retirement age.</p>

Even as retailers struggled, some of the worst pain was felt by the malls and shopping centers subsector -- while their tenants may have been able to transition to online retail, shopping center landlords were left holding the bag. The result was an extremely difficult year for shopping center REITs like Simon Property Group, the largest owner of shopping malls in the U.S.
