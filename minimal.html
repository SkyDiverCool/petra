            <p>Today my partner spoke to me for the third time about why she disagrees with my belief and practice of not tipping waitresses. To me, as long as all service staff are doing their job and getting paid an hourly wage, there is no reason to tip anyone, whether they mess up on my order or give me great service. “In 2021, with the onset of the COVID variants and the end of most pandemic relief programs, tipped workers report finding themselves facing more risks and even worse conditions than the first year of the pandemic,” according to a recent report by the nonprofit organization One Fair Wage.

            <p>Oil prices appear to have found much-needed support and holding above the psychologically important level of $80/barrel just days after a surprise crude build threatened to derail the bull camp. The broad energy sector benchmark, Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLE), has gained 48.5% YTD while its natural gas peer, the United States Natural Gas ETF (NYSEARCA:UNG), has vaulted 112.6%. Not even Big Oil has been spared, with the leader of the space, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) seeing its valuation shrink from $400B in 2014 to the current $260B.

Unfortunately, experts are warning that the catch-up trade might not materialize because the fossil fuel sector has a big nemesis to contend with: the trillion-dollar ESG megatrend. One is it's been a terrible place to be for a decade.</p>

LifeStrategy Income Fund VASIX, -0.12% typically holds only about 20% of its portfolio in equity funds, with the rest in bonds, perhaps a good fit for investors with ample resources (more than they think they’ll ever need, in other words) and those who are very skittish about the stock market. Vanguard Balanced Index Fund VBIAX, +0.27% is index driven, holding about 60% of its portfolio in 3,300 U.S. mostly growth-oriented stocks and the rest in about 10,700 bonds.</p>

Earnings: Of the 16 analysts surveyed by FactSet, IBM on average is expected to post adjusted earnings of $2.52 a share, down from the $2.60 a share expected at the beginning of the quarter, and the $2.58 a share reported in the year-ago third quarter. For instance, with the Software segment, which makes up about 40% of revenue, Grossman said that while it’s not explicit in IBM’s presentation, “management seemed to suggest that acquisitions would contribute about one point to software growth, implying organic growth of ~4%.”</p>

            <p>A percolating theme among retail investors came to a boil on Thursday and some meme stocks ended the day simmering

Since being knocked out of January’s short squeeze by online brokers trying to avoid margin calls, retail investors have been seeking alternatives to their multi-front war on short selling hedge funds, and after months of research they appear to have found it. In recent days, an increasing number of retail investors have swapped their torches, pitchforks and TD Ameritrade accounts for direct registration platforms like Computershare CPU, +1.24% , which have seen an influx of business from the meme crowd. But for Reddit’s retail Apes, there is one other huge perk to direct registration in meme stocks: keeping brokers, short sellers and market makers from creating a condition in which the amount of shares sold short in any given company exceed the total amount of shares outstanding. “When the music stops, there aren’t enough shares to go around,” said Susanne Trimbath, CEO of STP Advisory Services, and an economist who has been a key voice in educating retail investors on market structure.</p>

            <p>What's a better financial move: putting 20% down on a house or 10% and investing the rest? If you need to figure out how big your down payment should be, a financial advisor may be able to help you decide. Here’s a look at how that money could grow over a 30-year period (the SmartAsset Investment Calculator compounds interest monthly):

Retirement Savings Principal Investment Monthly Contributions Term Total $37,500 $0 30 years $743,902

Even without making monthly contributions to your brokerage account, putting 10% down and investing the remaining $37,500 will result in a sizable nest egg by the time your mortgage is fully paid. After approximately five years of making monthly payments, you would reach the 20% equity threshold and PMI would disappear, leaving you with an extra $175 every month.</p>

The global energy crisis is bleeding into the oil market. With natural gas trading at close to $200 in per-barrel terms in Europe, the consensus among analysts is that oil demand globally will be boosted by a further half a percentage point as companies rush to secure any fuel that can be used as a substitute, from diesel to fuel oil to crude. To outsiders, such a shift might seem tiny. In Europe, profits from making diesel are the highest since March 2020, while propane and low sulfur fuel oil prices have been rocketing to their highest since 2014.</p>

Once you begin taking distributions from your 401(k), or other retirement savings plan, such as an IRA, you won't owe Social Security tax on the distribution for the reason described above; you paid your dues during your working years. For those retiring early, at age 62, the maximum drops to $2,324, while those who wait until age 70—the latest you can defer—can collect a benefit of $3,895 per month. The Bottom Line
