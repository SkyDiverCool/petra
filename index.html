Older Americans have the opportunity to be healthier and wealthier, but an unsavvy financial tendency is ailing them. How Savers Accumulate Funds for Healthcare

Fewer than one in three adults (29%) reported that in the past 12 months they had put aside money to pay for healthcare expenses before they needed it. An HSA, which must be paired with a high-deductible health plan, lets you invest for future medical expenses, while enjoying special tax breaks. As health insurance plans ask people to pay for more of their healthcare out of their own pockets, such as through high deductibles, these tax-advantaged accounts can help people avoid having to choose between getting healthcare and not getting it.</p>
