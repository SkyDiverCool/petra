            <p class="fs-3">Oil futures rose Wednesday, shaking off earlier declines, as official government data showed that U.S. crude inventories climbed for the first time in eight weeks, but gasoline stockpiles posted a modest climb. In Wednesday dealings, November West Texas Intermediate crude CLX21, +0.28% CL.1, +0.28% rose 33 cents, or 0.4%, to $75.62 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, following a modest loss of 0.2% on Tuesday. On average, analysts expect the EIA on Thursday to report that U.S. natural-gas supplies rose by 87 billion cubic feet for the week ended Sept. 24, which would be above the five-year average increase of 72 billion, according S&P Global Platts.

Given the pullback in the stock, we think that creates a favorable risk/reward,” with Micron shares trading at 7.5 times his new earnings-per-share estimates for fiscal 2022.

            <p class="fs-3">U.S. stock benchmarks were attempting to recover Wednesday, following the worst selloff for the S&P 500 index in roughly four months this week, as surging bond yields spooked investors following last week’s confirmation from the Federal Reserve that it will soon begin winding down its easy-money policies as the economy recovers. In an update sent to Congressional leaders on Tuesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Congress must raise or suspend the debt limit by Oct. 18. “Investors are also troubled by the fact that we have arrived at this point where

Washington lawmakers are responsible for important financial and economic

outcomes when they have been challenged to find common ground on any issue over the last number of years,” said Alex Chaloff, co-head of investment strategies at Bernstein Private Wealth Management
