            <p class="fs-3">Jim Breyer, founder and CEO of Breyer Capital, would be a buyer of mega cap tech on pullbacks because he expects most of the FAANG stocks to lead the way in terms of next generation technology, he said Tuesday on CNBC's "TechCheck."

Breyer told CNBC he has been buying Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) over the last two years during pullbacks.

"For the last two years, when the mega-cap tech stocks sold off significantly, I'm a buyer. And the reason is they are also the leaders in the next generation technologies."

Next generation technologies include artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality and quantum communications and computing, he said.

"Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple: These are the best companies in the world and so I continue to believe that over the next three to five years they will continue to outperform."

These companies are recruiting the best talent in the world in order to continue to drive innovation in next generation technologies, Breyer said.

            <p class="fs-3">Vanguard Group announced significant price cuts for its fleet of target-date retirement funds this week. Currently, investors can own a Vanguard target fund for the seemingly low cost of 0.12% to 0.15% a year, equal to $12 to $15 for every $10,000 invested. The new price tag will be just 0.08%, effective February 2022.

It might not seem like much, but the price cuts will deliver an aggregate savings of $190 million to investors in 2022, says Vanguard. Price competition continues to be fierce in the investment management business. In a world of zero-dollar trading commissions and zero-cost index funds, financial firms are under intense pressure to lower expenses for investors.

Vanguard’s target funds are globally diversified portfolios built using index funds, effectively offering investors one-stop investment shopping. With the price cuts, its target-fund expenses will be on par with Charles Schwab’s target-index funds and below those of rival Fidelity Investments.

By lowering costs, Vanguard also addresses a longstanding complaint among its cost-conscious investors. Currently, Vanguard investors can save a few “basis points” by purchasing a target fund’s component index funds, thereby creating their own target fund. With the fee reduction, building your own target-date fund using the component parts won’t make much cost difference. The upshot: Vanguard investors will have the option to make their financial life simpler—by swapping over to a single target-date fund.

Vanguard also announced that more 401(k) plans will have access to its institutional target funds, which have even lower costs. The new plan minimum will be $100 million, down from $250 million.

In addition, Vanguard said it was introducing a new mutual fund, the Vanguard Target Retirement Income and Growth Trust, which is geared to retirees. The new fund will have a 50% stock allocation, higher than the 30% allocation used by the existing Vanguard Target Retirement Income Fund. Perhaps that higher stock allocation reflects the challenge of making a nest egg last over a 30-year retirement, while also generating decent returns in today’s world of tiny bond yields.

Many market strategists, including those at Vanguard, expect low stock and bond market returns in the years ahead. What to do? We can make sure we keep more of whatever the markets deliver—by keeping costs to a minimum. Vanguard’s target-fund price cuts will allow everyday investors to do just that, while also radically simplifying their financial lives.

The company said it will launch the cars in the second half of 2015, and it is working with automakers to produce the cars.

"We are working with our suppliers to get the cars ready for the upcoming deliveries," said Lucid Group spokesman Ryan O'Connell.

The company said it's aiming to sell about 20,000 of those cars during the first half of 2015.

Lucid has said it intends to have the first cars on the market by the end of this year.

The company said it expects to sell at least 50,000 units in the first half of 2015, and it is working with manufacturers to produce at least 100,000 units.

            <p class="fs-3">Micron Technology’s latest quarter didn’t go over well, and investors are punishing the stock. Shares of the chipmaker were down 2% in anticipation of the company’s earnings report and proceeded to tumble another 4% once the results were in. Investors were disappointed by Micron’s outlook, not its fiscal Q4 results.

Micron Earnings

Micron beat Wall Street estimates with fiscal Q4 EPS of $2.42 on revenue of $8.27 billion, up 37%. Micron’s outlook for Q1 2022 gave investors pause, however, as it paints the picture of weaker demand for its chips that are used in computers and mobile devices. The company’s guidance suggests that the good times, which have lasted for the past year, could be coming to an end for now.

Micron’s fiscal Q1 guidance is for revenue of $7.65 billion, while Wall Street was targeting something closer to $8.5 billion. Micron is aiming for EPS of $2.10 per share on a fully diluted basis, which is also below Street estimates.

Micron’s management team pointed to “supply chain challenges” that its PC customers are currently balancing. Micron’s revenue is diversified beyond just PC demand, but the company is still vulnerable to the ebbs and flows in demand, as its latest outlook has shown.

The sting is that Micron is coming off a record year in which demand for its chips was booming. Times were so good that Micron raised its prices in fiscal 2021, but now the outlook has become clouded and there might not be room to raise prices any further. Investors have not rewarded Micron shares along the way, with the stock down 1.2% year-to-date as investors have fled the volatility that is inherent with the chip sector.

Tech Trouble

It wasn’t just Micron shares that got pummeled on Tuesday, as the broader tech sector became the target amid rising Treasury yields. Oanda senior analyst Edward Moya is quoted by Bloomberg as saying,

“This surge in Treasury yields is kryptonite for the Nasdaq.”

Rising yields are especially threatening to high-growth stocks including technology companies, as it throws a wrench into their future earnings potential based on analyst models.

As for Micron, investors are disappointed about the short-term outlook. On the flip side, the company continues to generate billions in free cash flow, and Micron is a dividend-paying stock, which could help to soften the blow for investors.

            <p class="fs-3">(Bloomberg) -- Brightline Holdings, Fortress Investment Group’s rail company, will finalize the financing plans for its $8 billion project laying train tracks to Las Vegas from southern California within the next six months, Chief Executive Officer Michael Reininger said during a press briefing Tuesday.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Reininger said the company would benefit from the pending federal infrastructure bill, and is heading off some of the concerns that forced it to postpone a massive bond offering last year for the speculative venture. He was speaking about the delayed project, called Brightline West, at an event in Sacramento at the Siemens Mobility facility showcasing the latest trains for the company’s Florida line.

“We are working to set up Brightline West up for optimal success,” he said. “We are focused on eliminating the impediments that will bring certainty to the project, particularly from the finance perspective.”

The efforts include extensive planning for another California station in Rancho Cucamonga. The unrated bond offering that was supposed to sell last year would have financed a 169-mile (272-kilometer) line connecting Las Vegas to the desert town of Apple Valley, 90 miles away from downtown Los Angeles. A stop at Rancho Cucamonga, which is located along an existing commuter rail called Metrolink, would position passengers on the electric, high-speed line closer to the nation’s second-most populous city.

Fortress last year pulled the bond sale when it failed to attract enough investors even after it was downsized to $2.4 billion from $3.2 billion, showing that sweeteners and high yields weren’t enough to overcome reservations about a project that depends on the post-pandemic recovery of the travel and entertainment industries and has few comparisons in the U.S.

Likely Request

Reininger said the company will convert $1 billion of short-term financing for the Las Vegas project, issued to preserve its federal allocation of private activity bonds, into fixed-rate debt. Such debt, which are meant for ventures for the public interest, is limited. States also receive a capped amount of the debt from the federal government that they can bestow on projects. Last year, California and Nevada had extended a large portion of their allotments to the Las Vegas rail project, which was ultimately returned to the states when the company failed to sell the debt.

The firm is likely to request private activity bonds again, Reininger said, adding that “we probably will seek to get a little bit more to fill out the debt side of the equation as we move to the capital markets.”

It would take four years from construction to the first ride to Las Vegas, he said.

Reininger didn’t say how much the company hopes to gain if the federal infrastructure bill passes, but said it was important to its plans.

“It makes the rest of the equation easier to put together,” he said in an interview.

California Treasurer Fiona Ma said during the media event that she and representatives of the governor and controller, who decide which ventures receive the state’s private activity bonds “have all been uniformly aligned to make sure this project happens.”

“We can address climate change while creating good-paying manufacturing jobs and union construction jobs,” she said.

Meanwhile, Brightline plans to resume operations in November for its luxury train line in Florida, the country’s first new privately financed intercity passenger rail in a century. It launched the service in 2018 and then suspended the trains running between Miami and West Palm Beach in March 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. A bond due in 2049 traded Monday at an average yield of 6.2%, down from 7.56% in January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

            <p class="fs-3">JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said that Bitcoin may rise 10 times in price in the next five years.

The long-term Bitcoin critic also warned that it would be foolhardy to borrow money to buy Bitcoin.

Recently, the bank moved to give its wealth management clients access to cryptocurrency funds.

However, Dimon still claims he isn’t interested in owning a Bitcoin.

Dimon says Bitcoin is based on speculations

“I don’t know if it’s an asset. I don’t know if it’s a foreign exchange. I don’t know if it’s a currency,” he said.

“I don’t personally care. I am not a buyer of Bitcoin.

“I learned a long time ago – figure out what you want, do what you want and be successful yourself.”

He then went on to compare Bitcoin to the speculative tulip mania, a Beanie Babies craze and internet stocks.

In August, JPMorgan Chase signed a deal with the Bitcoin-focused institutional-grade platform New York Digital Investment Group to offer the passively managed Bitcoin fund.

Both Wells Fargo and JPMorgan also filed for passive Bitcoin funds for their wealthy clients, showing that, despite Dimon’s concerns, the banking sector is obviously not ignoring the growing demand for Bitcoin.

            <p class="fs-3">(Bloomberg) -- Micron Technology Inc., the largest U.S. maker of memory chips, fell in late trading after slowing demand from personal-computer makers hurt its forecast.Sales will be about $7.65 billion in the period ending in November, Micron said Tuesday in a statement. That compares with an average analyst estimate of $8.57 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding certain items, profit will be $2 to $2.10 a share, compared with a projection of $2.56.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The dimmer outlook suggests that slowing demand among PC makers is taking a toll. The memory chip industry is known for its dramatic boom-and-bust cycles, which make earnings hard to predict. But Micron Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra has argued that the wild swings between shortages and gluts have moderated because a wider variety of devices use the company’s chips now.

The stock fell as much as 7% to $67.99 in extended trading following the announcement. It had been down 2.8% this year, compared with a 19% advance by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.

A slowing of orders from PC makers is a short-term issue, according to Mehrotra. Some of his customers are struggling to get other types of components, meaning they can’t build all of the laptops and desktops that have been ordered. That’s led them to reduce memory inventory. The situation will reverse when industrywide shortages ease in the coming months, he said.

“PC is just one market but we have all of these other strong markets as well,” Mehrotra said in an interview. “The industry -- memory and storage -- is a different place today from in the past.”

Mehrotra said Micron isn’t expecting PC growth to continue at the frantic pace of the last year, but will settle at a much higher level of unit shipments than in the past. And other markets, such as automotive and industrial equipment, are growing quickly. Data centers have already overtaken PC to become the biggest user of memory, Mehrotra noted.

Story continues

Even before Tuesday’s news, Micron’s shares have lagged behind a broader run-up for chip stocks. Investors have remained cautious about the long-term prospects for companies in historically the most volatile part of the $400 billion industry.

Micron is coming off a surge in fiscal 2021, when heavy demand allowed the company to charge more. Its sales were $27.7 billion in the period, a record level and more than twice the total from five years ago. Over the years, the Boise, Idaho-based company has reported sales declines of more than 20% and gains of as much as 80%.

In the fiscal fourth quarter, Micron posted revenue of $8.27 billion, up 36% from a year earlier. Net income was $2.72 billion, or $2.39 a share, in the period, which ended Sept. 2. Micron is part of a global semiconductor supply chain that’s struggled to keep up with the pace of orders -- partly due to the pandemic. The shift to working from home spurred the need for technology, and production has also been disrupted by new flare-ups of Covid-19, which has caused factory shutdowns in hubs such as Malaysia.

Investors have expressed concern that the memory-chip boom was fueled in part by customers’ panic buying the products and hoarding inventory. Micron’s CEO said inventory levels are fine across his customers and low at memory producers.

Micron competes with South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc., and Japan’s Kioxia Holdings Corp. in a memory-chip market that has consolidated over the past decade. Samsung dominates production of both major types of chips, making it the world’s second-largest overall chipmaker, behind Intel Corp. DRAM chips hold data temporarily, helping processors crunch data. Nand-style flash memory, meanwhile, acts as permanent storage in phones and computers.

            <p class="fs-3">There are some bullish trades to put on in the oil patch to ride the new gusher in prices for black gold and natural gas, says Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta.

Mehta reiterated Buy ratings and aggressive upside price targets on oil majors ConocoPhillips (COP) and ExxonMobil (XOM) Monday. The analyst sees ConocoPhillips delivering a 20% return for investors over the next 12 months.

"The company should deliver 30%-40% of cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends/buybacks, has proven a core competency around M&A execution, offers a better geographic diversification than many E&Ps [exploration and production companies], but higher oil leverage than the U.S. majors. In addition, the stock trades at the highest free cash flow yield among the majors in 2022 and lowest EV/DACF multiple," Mehta contends.

Meanwhile, the analyst is even more optimistic on an ExxonMobil that has endured a challenging year that includes a board battle loss to activist Engine No. 1. Mehta believes ExxonMobil's stock has 24% total return potential in the course of 12 months.

Says Mehta, "Exxon is one of our most out of consensus ratings, where most investors we speak to are concerned about (a) the sustainability of earnings execution given weaker EPS surprise ratios than the S&P in recent years and (b) the premium valuation versus U.S. oil peers. However, we argue a premium valuation is justified by a strong asset base and historical trading patterns. We also see earnings beats continuing well into the future."

Year-to-date, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil shares are up 64% and 44%, respectively. The S&P 500 has gained 19%.

Mehta is the most bearish on Chevon (CVX) among the oil majors, assigning it a Hold rating.

Traders should brace for other sell-side oil analysts to follow Mehta's lead with upbeat calls into year-end. To be sure, oil and natural prices are rallying hard — which only lifts the case to be a long sector likely to see increase in profit forecasts for the fourth quarter and early 2022.

Oil prices tacked on their fifth straight day of gains Monday amid concerns over tight supplies as global economies recover from the pandemic. Brent crude oil touched levels not seen since October 2018, around $80 a barrel.

Natural gas prices have continued to soar since mid-August — prices are up 40% since Aug. 23, according to data from SunDial Capital Research.

Mehta's colleagues that cover the oil sector said Monday prices will likely still head higher from here.

"We forecast that this rally will continue, with our year-end Brent forecast of $90/bbl vs. $80/bbl previously. While we have long held a bullish oil view, the current global oil supply-demand deficit is larger than we expected, with the recovery in global demand from the Delta impact even faster than our above consensus forecast and with global supply remaining short of our below consensus forecasts," said Damien Courvalin, Goldman's head of energy research.

            <p class="fs-3">American multinational investment bank Morgan Stanley has reported the acquisition of around 30,000 shares in the investment vehicle Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.

The move was made by the Morgan Stanley Europe Opportunity Fund – an investment arm that specialises in emerging and established companies valued below market rate. The investment makes Morgan Stanley the second-largest shareholder within Grayscale, behind only Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management.

The announcement was made through the September 27 publication of the bank’s regulatory filings. Previous filings from June indicate that its investment increased by more than 30,000 shares in one quarter.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a leading institution in digital currency investment, holds more than $30bn worth of Bitcoin. It was announced earlier this year that the Trust intended to create its own Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund.

This is a notable advancement from the position that Morgan Stanley held only earlier this year. Back in March, the bank published a note to customers warning them of the dangers of investing in cryptocurrencies, and advising caution.

Since that point, however, MS first increased exposure in June to approximately $800,000 worth of investment. Since then it has acquired yet more stock, reaching a value somewhere in the region of $2.4m.

It has also been a hugely successful year for Grayscale, whose value skyrocketed on the back of the NFT created Ethereum rally. In early September it was reported that Grayscale’s value had eclipsed that of Bahrain.

Across Morgan Stanley’s various institutional funds, this brings its total shares in Grayscale to approximately 6.5 million.

            <p class="fs-3">(Bloomberg) -- Robinhood Markets Inc. and Citadel Securities responded to renewed criticism of their actions during January’s meme-stock frenzy, after retail investors filed a class-action lawsuit last week.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Citadel Securities, whose founder Ken Griffin testified about the episode during a February congressional hearing, fired off a series of tweets late Monday denying allegations that it pressured Robinhood to restrict trading. Robinhood, led by Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev, said in an emailed statement Tuesday that the lawsuit paints “a false narrative of collusion” with Citadel Securities.

Griffin added a statement of his own on Tuesday: “It must frustrate the conspiracy theorists to no end that Vlad and I have never texted, called or met each other. But I must say, kudos to Vlad and his team at Robinhood for their remarkable success story.”

Plaintiffs in the lawsuit allege that Citadel Securities amassed a substantial short position in GameStop Corp. and other stocks that exploded in value, and that the market-maker pressured Robinhood to stop customers from purchasing those shares, which the online brokerage did on Jan. 28.

Senior executives at both Citadel Securities and Robinhood had “numerous communications with each other that indicate that Citadel applied pressure on Robinhood,” according to the complaint filed Sept. 22 in federal court in Miami.

Both firms have pushed back against the notion that Citadel Securities directed the brokerage to restrict purchases. Robinhood has said it faced a large demand for collateral from a central clearinghouse and scrambled to raise more than $3 billion of additional capital in the following days.

Story continues

“We will work vigorously to continue correcting the record with the facts,” Robinhood said in its statement Tuesday. The firm’s securities unit “was communicating with market-makers in an effort to ensure continued market access for our customers.”

Citadel Securities also tweeted a rebuttal to an accusation that Griffin lied to lawmakers: “When asked whether Citadel Securities requested that Robinhood restrict trading, Ken Griffin truthfully told Congress, ‘Let me be perfectly clear. Absolutely not.’”

The saga has drawn attention to the complex machinery behind the execution of trades. Robinhood sends customer orders to Citadel Securities and other trading firms to be carried out, and accepts remuneration from those firms in what’s called payment for order flow.

While other retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab Corp. also use such arrangements, it’s particularly important to Robinhood, comprising about three-quarters of its revenue last year and 80% in the first half of 2021, filings show.

Payment for order flow, which critics have said poses potential conflicts of interest, faces fresh scrutiny from Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who has said that a ban is possible. Last week, Scion Asset Management’s Michael Burry said he received a subpoena from the SEC as a part of an investigation into the meme-stock madness.

Separately, Tenev defended his firm’s business model in a Wall Street Journal op-ed Tuesday. Payment for order flow, he wrote, allows the company to offer commission-free trades with no account minimums, “which has helped a new generation of retail investors get started.”

Banning the practice, he said, “is unlikely to help retail investors get better prices and would likely re-erect barriers that kept so many out of the market.”

Addressing criticisms that Robinhood lures inexperienced investors with game-like tactics to keep them trading more, he wrote: “Investing isn’t a game, but must it be grim and difficult to understand?”

            <p class="fs-3">Janet Yellen sounded the alarm for Congress Tuesday, warning that the U.S. Treasury will run out of cash around Oct. 18 if the federal debt limit is suspended or increased.

Republican Senators and House Democrats remain at odds, setting the stage for a second high-stakes government face-off, on top of the looming possible federal government shutdown.

What kind of effect would a debt ceiling default have on the average person? A pretty major one if you rely on the government for regular checks. Here are some of the potential impacts:

Will I still get my social security check if the debt ceiling isn’t raised or suspended?

You might not. By defaulting on the debt ceiling, the government will not be able to borrow to pay for operations, which could result in a delay for Social Security checks. Yellen, in an op-ed that appeared in The Wall Street Journal, said “nearly 50 million seniors could stop receiving Social Security checks for a time.” And the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare recently warned benefit checks could be delayed for weeks (and possibly longer) if Congress doesn’t act on the debt limit.

The money will still be there, since Social Security funds are separate from the government’s operating fund. But disbursing them could run into delays. It is worth noting, though, that the Social Security Administration has never missed a payment since its foundation in 1935.

Will government employees receive paychecks if the debt ceiling isn’t raised or suspended?

Federal employees, including the military, are paid, naturally, by the government. Failing to raise or suspend the debt ceiling effectively means the government can’t pay its bills, meaning paychecks possibly would be suspended until the situation is resolved.

Would failing to raise or suspend the debt ceiling affect my veterans' benefits?

Veterans would be affected by the debt crisis as well. Millions rely on pension payments to supplement their income—or as their sole source of income. Those payments would likely lapse if the situation is not resolved by Oct. 18.

Story continues

Will my monthly child tax credit still arrive?

Probably not on time. Yellen warned that the millions of people who rely on the monthly checks of up to $300 per child will experience delays.

How would a debt ceiling crisis impact Medicare?

Much like Social Security, it’s possible. The federal debt includes Medicare payments and the debt limit allows this program to be financed. Should the limit not be raised or suspended, it could cause delays in Medicare payments.

What impact would a U.S. default have on my stock portfolio?

That’s what analysts are trying to figure out now. The uncertainty over the debt ceiling and the possibility of a federal shutdown have certainly contributed to the stock market’s recent drops. Moody’s Analytics warned on Tuesday that a default would be “catastrophic” and said it could cut stock prices by as much as one-third, eliminating $15 trillion in household wealth.

What are the odds of a debt ceiling default really happening?

House Democrats have passed a stopgap spending bill that would keep the government running through December, which includes suspending the debt limit through December 2022. Senate Republicans, though, are strongly opposing the plan. Mitch McConnell has said the GOP will not support raising the debt limit.

Democrats need 10 Senate Republicans to jump the aisle for the bill to succeed, which doesn’t look likely at present. McConnell has suggested Democrats shift the debt ceiling language to their budget reconciliation package, which doesn’t need any Republican votes. Democrats are pushing for a bipartisan agreement, though.

It’s a political game of chicken, but the odds of a default do seem to be increasing.

            <p class="fs-3">(Bloomberg) -- China stepped in to buy a stake in a struggling regional bank from China Evergrande Group as it seeks to limit contagion in the financial sector from the embattled property developer.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Evergrande agreed to sell a 20% stake in Shengjing Bank Co. to the local Shenyang government for 10 billion yuan ($1.55 billion), with the bank demanding that all proceeds go to settle debts with the lender, according to a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. In that case, the sale would do little to help Evergrande pay its massive debts to bond holders and homebuyers.

The sale illustrates how authorities are taking steps to minimize fallout to the banking system from the worsening liquidity crisis at Evergrande as they try to avoid a bailout. At least 10 banks told investors earlier this month that they have sufficient collateral for loans to the developer and that risks are under control. Hong Kong’s central bank asked lenders to report their exposure to Evergrande Group, according to people familiar with the matter.

“Maintaining social and financial sector stability is still the overarching policy objective of the Chinese government,” said Nicholas Zhu, a senior analyst at Moody’s Investors Service. “Authorities, including local governments, will take policy measures and assume coordination roles to ensure that the resolution of Evergrande does not cause social or financial instability.”

In a sign of investor nervousness toward the banking industry, Dongguan Rural Commercial Bank Co. plunged on its debut in Hong Kong. The lender listed its exposure to the real estate sector as a risk factor in a preliminary prospectus, saying the industry accounted for 8.8% of its commercial loans as of March 31.

Story continues

Evergrande will sell about 1.75 billion non-publicly traded domestic shares in Shengjing Bank to Shenyang Shengjing Finance Investment Group Co. at 5.7 yuan apiece, according to the statement. The developer’s stake in the lender will drop to 14.57% after the latest transaction, which requires relevant approvals. Evergrande raised about 1 billion yuan from a previous stake sale of Shengjing Bank in August.

The transaction underscores the mounting pressure on billionaire Hui Ka Yan to spin off and sell assets to pay down a mountain of debt. Evergrande’s original 36% stake in Shengjing Bank was among its most valuable financial assets, worth about $2.8 billion. That holding became less appealing as regulators toughened oversight on dealings such as preferential lending and bond purchases between banks and their largest shareholders.

Evergrande shares climbed 15% in Hong Kong, paring their year-to-date decline to about 80%. Its dollar bond due 2022 fell 1.3 cents on the dollar to 24.9 cents, set for a fresh record closing low, according to Bloomberg-compiled prices. Shengjing Bank rose 1.4%.

The bank posted a more-than 60% drop in first-half profit due to a decline in net interest income and higher impairment losses on assets.

“The company’s liquidity issue has adversely affected Shengjing Bank in a material way,” Evergrande said in the statement, adding that the introduction of the purchaser will help to stabilize the bank’s operations.

A report in May from Caixin Media’s WeNews said the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission was examining more than 100 billion yuan of transactions between the two. Evergrande boosted its stake in Shengjing Bank in 2019, following a request from authorities who wanted to recapitalize the lender, Bloomberg reported last year.

Evergrnade is facing mounting pressure to repay its debts. The firm has already fallen behind on its payments to banks, suppliers and holders of onshore investment products. It’s made no public statements on an $83.5 million coupon that was due Sept. 23 and at least several holders had said they hadn’t received the funds.

Fitch Ratings downgraded the developer’s credit rating to C from CC on Wednesday, saying Evergrande likely missed interest payment on senior unsecured notes and entered a 30-day grace period.

The developer needs to pay a $45.2 million coupon on Wednesday for a dollar bond that matures 2024, Bloomberg-compiled data show.

“With so many upcoming coupon payments towards year-end, selling non-core assets is the most efficient way for Evergrande to raise funds,” said Steven Leung, executive director of UOB Kay Hian. The central government is “watching very closely” on the proceeds from asset sales, he said.

            <p class="fs-3">Small scale real-estate investors are less enthusiastic about the state of the U.S. housing market — and their reasons for worry largely mirror those of the average home buyer today, according to a new survey.

Real-estate data company RealtyTrac reported that 48% of individual real-estate investors view the investment market as being worse or much worse than it was a year ago, based on the results of a survey the company conducted. That’s up from 45% of investors in last year’s edition of the same survey.

RealtyTrac polled mom-and-pop investors who purchase between one to 10 properties a year — including both investors who flip the homes and those who hold onto them as rental units. These investors own most of the single-family rental properties in the country.

Notably, RealtyTrac found that a smaller share of investors in this edition of the survey planned to flip the homes. That aligns with previous research from RealtyTrac’s parent company, Attom Data Solutions, that found that the frequency of home-flipping was down compared to historical levels as profit margins remained depressed.

As for the top concerns among real-estate investors, the most-cited response was the rising cost of homes, which 63% of respondent listed as a major challenge. Next was the lack of available inventory, which was cited by 57% of investors.

“Nearly two-thirds of real-estate investors view the rising cost of homes as a major challenge.”

Other major worries included the cost of materials and labor for home building and improvement projects, as well as competition from traditional home buyers.

“It’s no wonder that individual investors believe that the market is less favorable today than it was a year ago,” Rick Sharga, executive vice president at RealtyTrac, said in the report.

Another issue that could be factoring into investors’ views on the state of the U.S. housing market is the situation with foreclosures. The availability of mortgage forbearance and an ongoing moratorium on foreclosures at the federal level has meant that foreclosure activity was down some 70% in August versus the same time period in 2019. According to RealtyTrac, the number of homes in foreclosure is at the lowest level on record.

Because of the appreciation in home prices, many people who are in forbearance and behind on mortgage payments may be able to sell their homes rather than go into default. Investors remain divided as to whether they believe that foreclosure activity will return to normal in the future or surpass typical levels, the survey found.

            <p class="fs-3">(Bloomberg) -- One of Vanguard’s exchange-traded funds has just taken the crown for the biggest annual inflow, giving the issuer an edge over competitors within the $6.8 trillion U.S. industry.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Investors have poured $41.1 billion into the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (ticker VOO) so far this year, surpassing the 2008 record of $39.5 billion held by State Street’s SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ticker SPY). Vanguard also issued the next four ETFs with the most inflows this year, as of data reported Tuesday.

“It just shows the continued rise and utter dominance of Vanguard,” said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.

“2008 was the year that made ETFs, because people saw they could handle a real crisis and provide liquidity,” he said. “So for VOO to pass that record is pretty big.”

It’s been an unprecedented year for the industry as investors poured more cash in U.S.-listed ETFs in the first seven months of the year than in any full calendar year on record. The influx comes as shareholders have been looking to ride the stock market rally on the economy’s rebound from the pandemic.

SPY is the biggest ETF in the U.S. industry, but VOO and BlackRock’s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (ticker IVV) have been gaining ground. SPY has an expense ratio of 0.095%, while VOO and IVV both have fees of 0.03%.

“With ETFs that track the same index, retail investors in particular are making the right decision and paying as little as possible,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA.

VOO is a share class of the Vanguard 500 index fund, and its flows may have been getting an extra kick from investors migrating to it from the mutual fund share class, Balchunas said.

But still, “what’s special about Vanguard is they have such trust built up,” he said. Since Vanguard had been lowering fees before many others, “they were just completely branded as the low cost provider, and that still pays off.”

Most Read from Bloomberg

Brent futures slid back below $79, while West Texas Intermediate also dropped. The American Petroleum Institute reported a 4.13 million-barrel weekly gain in U.S. crude stocks, according to people familiar with the data. That would be the first increase in eight weeks if confirmed by government data later Wednesday.

Oil’s advance earlier this week reflected signs of a tighter global market amid stronger demand and rising natural gas prices. Higher energy costs this month have stoked speculation that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies may ease supply cuts more quickly. The White House said Tuesday it’s continuing to talk to OPEC and other international partners about the importance of competitive markets and doing more to support the recovery.

“The oil market is coming under further pressure this morning after the API reported an unexpected uptick in U.S. oil stocks last week,” said Stephen Brennock, an analyst at brokerage PVM Oil Associates. “The latest price pullback suggests pockets of worry are still present across the oil market.”

Stockpiles in the U.S. expanded across the board last week, including crude at the key storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, according to people familiar with the API data. Gasoline holdings climbed for a second week, rising by 3.6 million barrels, while distillates inventories gained 2.5 million barrels.

 TL;DR: Oil companies suck by their shareholders

If you want to see more oil price movement, you need to look for the oil companies that are currently pumping capital to buy from and sell at the highest prices. In this way, they are giving investors a better chance at getting the most out of their money with the most profits.

But oil companies are not really good at producing capital. They are not good at taking advantage of the abundant supply of cash they get out of their companies. Their shareholders can't get the cash they need to buy any more. They want to keep the money they get from their companies so the company can keep its profits going.

The bottom line is that investing in oil and gas companies and the oil companies that generate the most cash flow is not the way</p>
