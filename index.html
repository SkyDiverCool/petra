            <p class="fs-3">“Socialism” is a loaded word in the United States—a country where capitalism is the prevailing economic system and is the basis for the system of government. For example, if you work for a company that offers a 401(k) plan, you can decide what percentage of each paycheck (if any) to redirect to that account—although government regulations place restrictions on how much you can contribute. Under a public retirement system or a Section 218 agreement, some state and local government employees are covered while not paying into Social Security. Nevertheless, because the American government plays such a dominant role in the U.S. Social Security system—deciding how much and when employees and employers pay into the system, how much individuals receive in benefits when they get them, and preventing almost everyone from opting out—it only seems fair to say that Social Security is, in effect, a form of democratic socialism.</p>

Shortages of natural gas and rising demand are leading to an energy crunch that has now spread around the world. In general, gas companies used derivative financial instruments to lock in prices months ago, so the latest price surge probably won’t help them, Dingmann said in an interview.

The Irvine, California-based startup in a filing Friday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission listed the size of the offering as $100 million, a placeholder that will change when terms of the share sale are set.

FEMA has so far only published estimates at the zip code level and not for individual properties, making it too early to tell what share of the burden will fall on low-income homeowners, whose properties, in part because of redlining and other forms of historical prejudice, are more likely to be situated in high-risk areas.
