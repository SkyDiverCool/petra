Kristi Noem summoned to her office the state employee who ran the agency, the woman’s direct supervisor and the state labor secretary. Noem declined an interview request and her office declined to answer detailed questions about the meeting. “‘It’s clearly a conflict of interest and an abuse of power for the benefit of a family member.’” — Peters began working as a state-registered appraiser in 2016.

            <p class="fs-3">As Washington teeters closer to a possible government shutdown at midnight Thursday, here’s why the status of the nation’s debt ceiling may ignite more worry in financial markets. Still, after a couple of topsy-turvy years in which the previously unthinkable became real, some Washington and Wall Street professionals have been girding for a worst-case scenario. If it does happen, it turns a manufactured political crisis into an economic crisis. While most analysts expected a mid-October “X date,” when Treasury will run out of money to pay bills, Yellen on Tuesday told Congressional leaders that it would be Oct. 18. “ Beacon’s Koltun, among others, thinks markets will start to get antsy even earlier than that. Read: U.S. seen running out of cash between Oct. 15 and Nov. 4, as debt-limit drama continues

The very idea of a U.S. default remains so incongruous that the reaction in financial markets isn’t the only unknown. For now, there are two possible scenarios:

If the Treasury Department knows that it will miss a payment, it would ideally announce that at least a day in advance. That would allow the maturity dates of the bonds in question to be changed: a Monday maturity date would be changed to Tuesday, a Tuesday maturity would be changed to Wednesday, and so on. While that sounds relatively orderly, it still leaves many unknowns.</p>

Yet, some experts are saying that this rally is far from over. The latest data by the Energy Information Administration shows that nat. Interestingly, the analysts note that U.S. consumption isn't really the driving force behind the strong price action. In the first half of the year, the U.S. exported roughly 10% of its natural gas, or 41% more than a year ago. Normally, excess natural gas produced during the summer would go into underground storage. For instance, Russia, Europe's most important natural-gas provider, has been slowing its deliveries. Europe's natural gas spot prices have historically been lower than prices in Asia; however, this year, Europe's natural gas prices are tracking Asia's spot LNG prices more closely to attract flexible LNG supplies from around the world to refill storage inventories. During times of falling crude prices, oil and gas producers normally use a short hedge to lock in oil prices if they believe prices are likely to go even lower in the future.

            <p class="fs-3">(Bloomberg) -- If there's any country that might've been in a position to rescue Europe from its energy crisis, it’s the U.S. — home to vast shale fields holding a seemingly endless supply of natural gas and giant terminals capable of liquefying it and shuttling it abroad. Meanwhile, many major shale drillers have been funneling cash to shareholders and focusing on climate goals rather than boosting production. Americans are likely to face some of their highest energy bills in years. Makers of plastics, fertilizers and other gas-derived products seized on the flood of cheap, reliable shale gas, spending billions of dollars to build or expand manufacturing plants. Among U.S. shale executives, “there's been a dramatic shift in sentiment away from production growth and toward shareholder returns and ESG initiatives,'' Connor McLean, an analyst at BTU, said in an interview, referring to environmental, social and governance goals. Gas stored in underground U.S. salt caverns and depleted water aquifers — a crucial source of fuel to augment pipelined supplies during the peak demand of winter months — is 21% below the 10-year average for this time of year, according to research firm Vortexa Ltd. That helps explain why U.S. prices are surging. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gas for October delivery on Monday jumped 11% and topped $5.50 per million British thermal units for the first time since early 2014, when the Polar Vortex enveloped much of the U.S. in record-breaking cold. In California, which is dealing with a unique set of challenges that include a scarcity of hydro power and summer-driven demand for electricity to run air conditioners, prices already are surging.

            <p class="fs-3">Janet Yellen sounded the alarm for Congress Tuesday, warning that the U.S. Treasury will run out of cash around Oct. 18 if the federal debt limit is suspended or increased. And the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare recently warned benefit checks could be delayed for weeks (and possibly longer) if Congress doesn’t act on the debt limit. But disbursing them could run into delays. Much like Social Security, it’s possible. Senate Republicans, though, are strongly opposing the plan. Mitch McConnell has said the GOP will not support raising the debt limit. Democrats are pushing for a bipartisan agreement, though.</p>

            <p class="fs-3">(Bloomberg) -- China stepped in to buy a stake in a struggling regional bank from China Evergrande Group as it seeks to limit contagion in the financial sector from the embattled property developer. Most Read from Bloomberg

Evergrande agreed to sell a 20% stake in Shengjing Bank Co. to the local Shenyang government for 10 billion yuan ($1.55 billion), with the bank demanding that all proceeds go to settle debts with the lender, according to a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. At least 10 banks told investors earlier this month that they have sufficient collateral for loans to the developer and that risks are under control. Evergrande shares climbed 15% in Hong Kong, paring their year-to-date decline to about 80%. Evergrande boosted its stake in Shengjing Bank in 2019, following a request from authorities who wanted to recapitalize the lender, Bloomberg reported last year. The central government is “watching very closely” on the proceeds from asset sales, he said.</p>

A rebound in oil prices — and oil stocks — presents an unexpected opportunity for investors to collect some healthy dividend checks while fundamentals continue to improve. ExxonMobil (XOM)

While many big energy companies are steadily moving towards renewables, Exxon is committed to oil and gas, providing investors with a relatively pure way to jump into the space. In the most recent quarter, for instance, Exxon earned $4.7 billion in profits on revenue of $67.7 billion thanks to significant recovery in demand. While the company hasn’t invested much capital in renewable sources of energy, Chevron’s significant position in the attractive Permian Basin and impressive free cash flow generation should give investors plenty of reasons to be bullish about. Meanwhile, free cash flow clocked in at multiyear high of $5.2 billion. Chevron shares are also off 11% from their 52-week highs and currently provide a dividend yield of 5.3%, giving dividend value investors something to think about. To be sure, Chevron trades at more than $100 per share.</p>

I have a $1,200-a-month mortgage, while my home is currently valued at around $350,000. I don’t have $1 million or more as I had planned. You have shown the world and yourself that you have what it takes to keep moving forward. You have done what needs to be done to take back control of your life. I made a decision at the beginning of the pandemic that I was not going to worry about something that was beyond my control. Continue to save, diversify your investments, and make an effort to pay off your credit-card debt and car loans — you will feel better when you have done so. It may also help you to have a mantra when you wake up in the morning and go to sleep at night: “Thank you, Universe, for helping me to put a roof over my head and money in the bank, and for restoring security to my life.

            <p class="fs-3">Bank stocks have had a good run in 2021, but they still lag behind the broader market’s recovery since the pandemic doldrums of 2020. And now that the Federal Reserve seems likely to allow interest rates to rise soon, the banks may have an easier time improving their profits. In other industries you may have healthy profitable companies that have negative equity. This includes some companies that are investment banks and/or brokers. Schwab does so through its subsidiary, Charles Schwab Bank SSB. Looking back over the past 20 reported quarters through June 30, here are the 20 banks with the highest average returns on common equity. In comparison, the S&P 1500 banking industry group returned 124% and the S&P Composite 1500 returned 111% over the same period.</p>

While signaling that Berkshire plans to return significant amounts of capital to stockholders through this method, Buffett adds that this plan is another reason to abandon his former focus on book value.

            <p class="fs-3">(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. and Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. fell after the two Canadian miners announced a “merger of equals” that offered investors a lower deal premium than other gold combinations. Stock moves after the deal was announced turned that premium into a discount. Still, Newmont Corp.’s takeover of Goldcorp Inc. in 2019 generated about a 17% premium, while Kirkland’s purchase of Detour Gold Corp. later that year came in with about a 24% premium. Agnico had been shied away from large deals in the past, but this deal is “more about a number of mines and location of mines in terms of manageability, rather than an overall ounce number,” Boyd said.
