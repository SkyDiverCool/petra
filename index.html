Sometimes an inheritance includes more than a house or an heirloom vase. Determining the value of such a bequest is vital. Without the proper calculations or procedures, you could face hefty tax consequences. Consider working with a financial advisor on estate planning challenges, such as how to value things you inherit. In this case, it�s the purchase price of an asset like a stock and it�s adjusted for anything that impacted the value, i.e., dividends, commissions, fees or gains. This perk is known as the stepped-up basis loophole. Whether you inherited the stocks through a brokerage, will or trust, calculating the cost-basis stays the same. However, only the amount that goes over the minimum will actually face the tax. But as long as the estate�s overall value sits below limits, the heir won�t face taxes as part of the inheritance. Other Tax Considerations on Inherited Stocks

You might not have to go looking for the cost basis of the inherited stock. Also, some states require heirs to submit a tax waiver for their inherited accounts. The Takeaway

            <p class="fs-3">As Washington teeters closer to a possible government shutdown at midnight Thursday, here�s why the status of the nation�s debt ceiling may ignite more worry in financial markets. Still, after a couple of topsy-turvy years in which the previously unthinkable became real, some Washington and Wall Street professionals have been girding for a worst-case scenario. If it does happen, it turns a manufactured political crisis into an economic crisis. While most analysts expected a mid-October �X date,� when Treasury will run out of money to pay bills, Yellen on Tuesday told Congressional leaders that it would be Oct. 18. � Beacon�s Koltun, among others, thinks markets will start to get antsy even earlier than that. Read: U.S. seen running out of cash between Oct. 15 and Nov. 4, as debt-limit drama continues

The very idea of a U.S. default remains so incongruous that the reaction in financial markets isn�t the only unknown. For now, there are two possible scenarios:

If the Treasury Department knows that it will miss a payment, it would ideally announce that at least a day in advance. That would allow the maturity dates of the bonds in question to be changed: a Monday maturity date would be changed to Tuesday, a Tuesday maturity would be changed to Wednesday, and so on. While that sounds relatively orderly, it still leaves many unknowns.</p>

While many big energy companies are steadily moving towards renewables, Exxon is committed to oil and gas, providing investors with a relatively pure way to jump into the space. In the most recent quarter, for instance, Exxon earned $4.7 billion in profits on revenue of $67.7 billion thanks to significant recovery in demand. While the company hasn�t invested much capital in renewable sources of energy, Chevron�s significant position in the attractive Permian Basin and impressive free cash flow generation should give investors plenty of reasons to be bullish about. Meanwhile, free cash flow clocked in at multiyear high of $5.2 billion. Chevron shares are also off 11% from their 52-week highs and currently provide a dividend yield of 5.3%, giving dividend value investors something to think about. To be sure, Chevron trades at more than $100 per share.</p>

In addition to the sometimes hefty fees incurred by annuitants, you risk losing part of your investment if you die prematurely, as you may not be able to pass the remainder of the annuity on to your beneficiaries. The specific fees charged by your insurance company vary with the type of investment you choose. Variable annuities tend to have higher fees than their fixed counterparts because they require a more active, engaged management style. These fees cover management and administrative expenses incurred throughout the year. Other fees may be one-time up-front costs, such as a sales fee to cover the commission of the person who sold you the annuity or a contract fee. Additionally, annuity plans offered in a 401(k) are now portable.</p>

Germany went to the polls on Sunday to choose a new leader, bringing a close to the era of Angela Merkel after her 16 years in power. Droughts in Brazil, reduced output in the North Sea and other global supply and demand pressures as economies reopen from the pandemic have sent wholesale natural gas costs spiralling, with little sign of easing off over winter. About 310,000 German households are already facing an 11.5pc increase to bills of about �172. Story continues

Analysts expect Nord Stream 2 will lower gas prices in Europe and help keep Europe supplied at a time when its own production is declining. Among those trying to make sure the project succeeds is Merkel�s predecessor Gerhard Schroeder, 77, who signed up to work for Gazprom�s first Baltic Sea pipeline project (now known as Nord Stream 1) after leaving office in 2005, one of the more controversial career moves among former Western leaders. In all, about 40pc of Europe�s gas comes from Russia. But the US and Germany have since struck a deal allowing the project to go ahead, albeit promising to punish Russia if it tried to use the pipeline to harm Ukraine. The Greens have called for it to be scrapped. Of course they are going to use this opportunity to put pressure on the German regulator.�</p>

While Gotcher never names Zillow, social media users have suggested the company might be his target because of its size, popularity, and the fact that the company has created its own real estate program called Zillow Offers that buys and sells single-family homes. We pay market value for every home we purchase. If we make too low of an offer � homeowners won�t use us,� the statement read. Redfin also shared a statement with Yahoo Finance, arguing that Gotcher�s theory isn�t plausible because under their iBuyer program RedfinNow, the company only sold 292 homes in its second quarter.

Failing to lift the limit is simply deciding not to pay bills already incurred. And not paying these bills would be disastrous. There are a few other methods by which the president might ignore the debt ceiling, including declaring it unconstitutional or creating new debt securities, but the coin is arguably the most elegant solution, and certainly the most popular on Twitter, where advocates using the #MTFC hashtag�mint the fucking coin, to be clear�are calling on Biden to avoid a crisis and the surrounding dramatics altogether

A decision to mint the coin would likely survive legal challenges (pdf). Obama�s presidency arguably never recovered. Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke came as close to begging for public spending as it is possible for a Fed chair to do in his annual appearances at legislative hearings. The discussion of Modern Monetary Theory promoted by economist Stephanie Kelton has helped policymakers understand that a US government that controls its own currency doesn�t need to worry about arbitrary levels of debt as much as the actual resources required by the economy. Economic policymakers like to be thought of as serious, both because their work is undeniably weighty and because investors seek certainty from monetary authorities.</p>

            <p class="fs-3">(Bloomberg) -- Pressure on Democrats to increase the federal debt limit and avert a crippling default escalated on Monday, with the party facing a cumbersome legislative procedure that could complicate efforts to deliver on Joe Biden�s economic agenda. An eventual Democrat-only vote to raise the debt limit would provide fodder for election attack ads. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said the government will run out of money some time in October. Blake Gwinn, head of U.S. rates strategy for RBC Capital Markets, said he doesn�t expect any broad market impact from the debt-limit fight beyond Treasury debt maturing in that narrow window, unless the country gets �within a few days� of default or a major credit rating agency downgrades the U.S. debt rating, as occurred in 2011. During the debt limit battles of 2011 and 2013 investors grew worried as default neared. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland dismissed the idea of going through the convoluted process and predicted Republicans would eventually go along with a debt ceiling increase.</p>

Conflicting reactions in the two countries illustrate the existential crisis confronting HSBC and its leader. Its name alone speaks volumes: the Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp., a legacy of a British colonial past when the company essentially ran China�and the U.K. ran much of the world. HSBC still has an empire, if a humbled one. They asked whether he�d consider pulling up stakes because of human-rights abuses in China. � He�s no blue-blooded British banker who read history or literature at Oxbridge, no denizen of the Davos set. His family, who trace their roots to Ireland, worked in construction; his first job was digging holes on a building site. He earned an accounting degree from vocational Birmingham Polytechnic. Square-jawed and thickset, he looks a bit like a rugby player, though a friend says he has slimmed down recently so he can take on the demands of the job. Five years later, HSBC bought Midland�acquiring Quinn as well. He managed to win over the staff with his financial expertise and work ethic, according to a senior executive familiar with his time in Asia. Brexit had eroded its position in Europe, where business was sluggish. Quinn is taking much of HSBC down a peg, too. It�s all in keeping with one of his main strategies as CEO: ruthless cost-cutting. Quinn says he wants to slash HSBC�s �office footprint� by 40%, with every employee sharing a desk. In an interview in September with Bloomberg Television, Quinn staked out a different position from many Wall Street CEOs on whether employees will ever return to the office as before. With all these cost savings, financial results have �stabilized. Quinn is doubling down on the headquarters and all it represents. In August, HSBC agreed to buy Axa�s Singapore insurance business for $575 million. And don�t just think about wealth in China as the super-rich, it�s also wealth for everybody.� In a statement, HSBC said the bank is confident about its position in China and is the leading foreign bank in underwriting government debt and providing secondary-market trading. Not long after, Tugendhat told a reporter that he sympathized with Quinn, that he understood HSBC�s importance, its need to make a profit, and the challenge of weighing corporate interests and human rights. � HSBC.Wilson covers U.K. finance in London.</p>
