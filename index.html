            <p class="fs-3">But according to Goldman Sachs’ chief of global equity strategy, Peter Oppenheimer, this is the beginning of an opportunity.
Oppenheimer believes that investors should prepare to ‘buy the dip,’ and get into the stock market should prices fall.
The stock boasts a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 4 Buys and 1 Hold.
The analyst rates the stock a Buy and gives it a $32 price target, indicating a one-year upside of 60%.

Founded in 1950 by members of the Kariyo family, who still own 70%, Penti has 300 stores in Turkey and a presence in around 29 countries.
An IPO could involve both the sale of some shares by Carlyle and the family, two of the people said.
It paid around $100 million for 30% of Penti and considered an IPO of its minority holding three years ago, according to Reuters.

            <p class="fs-3">There are some bullish trades to put on in the oil patch to ride the new gusher in prices for black gold and natural gas, says Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta.
Mehta reiterated Buy ratings and aggressive upside price targets on oil majors ConocoPhillips (COP) and ExxonMobil (XOM) Monday.
Mehta is the most bearish on Chevon (CVX) among the oil majors, assigning it a Hold rating.
Natural gas prices have continued to soar since mid-August — prices are up 40% since Aug. 23, according to data from SunDial Capital Research.

            <p class="fs-3">As Washington teeters closer to a possible government shutdown at midnight Thursday, here’s why the status of the nation’s debt ceiling may ignite more worry in financial markets.
The debt ceiling, which is the amount of money lawmakers authorize the Treasury Department to borrow, must be suspended or raised by mid-October, or the United States likely will default on its debt.
In a research note published September 22, Barclays analyst Joseph Abate noted there’s additional uncertainty over the debt ceiling now because it coincides with a funding package Congress needs to pass.
Read: U.S. seen running out of cash between Oct. 15 and Nov. 4, as debt-limit drama continuesThe very idea of a U.S. default remains so incongruous that the reaction in financial markets isn’t the only unknown.
If that happens, there would be a holder of record for the debt on the day before the maturity was scheduled, who would be entitled to get paid.</p>

            <p class="fs-3">The Securities and Exchange Commission charged two traders with engaging in illegal so-called wash trading of meme stocks, including GameStop Inc., in an alleged scheme that netted them hundreds of thousands of dollars in ill-gotten rebates from a number of stock brokers.
They pay these fees to ensure that there will be someone on the other side of trade for those placing marketable orders, who in turn pay a “take” fee.
Make fees are typically smaller than take fees, with market makers pocketing the difference.
According to the SEC’s complain, certain brokers will pass make and take fees on to their clients, while others don’t.
Gu and Lee used these market dynamics to their advantage, correctly surmising that they could earn larger fees than normal by ordering out-of-the-money put options on these and other stocks, the SEC said.</p>

“That goes not just for individuals but institutions as well, especially pension funds is one source of major assets out there.
The ease with which investors can now buy digital coins, through platforms like Coinbase (COIN), Paypal (PYPL), and Robinhood (HOOD), have also led to increased exposure.
“Bitcoin has tended to outperform when they're collectively going lower and [crypto assets] do tend to remain directionally in step,” she said.</p>

As with an annuity, you do not pay income tax on your contributions or interest until you withdraw those funds after retirement.

            <p class="fs-3">(Bloomberg) -- China’s energy crisis is shaping up as the latest shock to global supply chains as factories in the world’s biggest exporter are forced to conserve energy by curbing production.
Local governments are ordering the power cuts as they try to avoid missing targets for reducing energy and emissions intensity, while some are facing an actual lack of electricity.
Fabric makers in the province that are suffering production halts have started to hike prices and postpone taking new overseas orders, he said.
The company expects output to resume from Oct. 1 and said it will look to minimize the impact of the closure.

Republicans refused to back the debt ceiling suspension even though a major portion of the current debt accumulated under GOP control of Congress and the White House.
Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell also has said he doesn’t want a default or shutdown but is insisting Democrats provide all the votes to raise the debt limit.
During the debt limit battles of 2011 and 2013 investors grew worried as default neared.
Democrats can raise the debt ceiling on their own through a process called reconciliation, which bypasses the filibuster in the Senate.</p>

“Undoubtedly, the quickest launch of Nord Stream 2 would significantly balance out the pricing parameters of natural gas in Europe, including on the spot market,” said Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Petrov, on September 15.
Story continuesAnalysts expect Nord Stream 2 will lower gas prices in Europe and help keep Europe supplied at a time when its own production is declining.
In 2016, he also became chairman of the board of directors of Nord Stream 2.

Futures on the Nasdaq, a proxy for technology and growth stocks, underperformed against the other two major stock indexes, dropping 1.5% ahead of the opening bell.
The rapid rotation away from growth and technology stocks came as Treasury yields added to recent gains.
However, the rapid rise in borrowing costs also serves as a headwind to "long-duration" growth stocks, which are valued heavily on future earnings.
In prepared remarks, Yellen addressed the ongoing debt ceiling debate, reiterating her concern over the negative implications to the U.S. economy, should lawmakers fail to take action.</p>

Gold and other tangible assets including real estate also have reputations as inflation hedges.
Energy stocks, for example, make up less than 3% of the broad Standard & Poor's 500 index.
Bond investors could get hammered if inflation and inflationary expectations continue to rise and if interest rates creep higher, as seems plausible.
