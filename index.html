PMV is working to create personalized cancer treatments, patient-specific based on particular p53 mutations. The p53 gene activates in response to DNA damage, which is frequently implicated in tumor formation. PMV is working to develop treatments based on small-molecule therapeutics that selectively target mutated p53, to restore its natural anti-tumor function. Enrollment in the trial is ongoing, and 12 clinical testing sites have been selected in the US. The company has successfully acquired a Fast Track designation from the FDA for PC14586. Goldman Sachs' Paul Choi is impressed with PMV’s potential, writing of the company: “Although investor expectations are admittedly varied, with shares having traded sideways for most of 2021, we think PMVP presents an attractive risk/reward into upcoming Phase 1 data… with even modest success here relative to a low clinical hurdle potentially driving meaningful upside given that p53 (like KRAS) remains one of the untapped white spaces within oncology.” The company came into being just as the COVID crisis was starting to abate, and its revenues, reported for the first half of this year, came to $84 billion. The acquisition will give Stellantis a stronger entry into the US automotive financing market. The analyst rates the stock a Buy and gives it a $32 price target, indicating a one-year upside of 60%.

            <p class="fs-3">(Bloomberg) -- China stepped in to buy a stake in a struggling regional bank from China Evergrande Group as it seeks to limit contagion in the financial sector from the embattled property developer. Most Read from Bloomberg

Evergrande agreed to sell a 20% stake in Shengjing Bank Co. to the local Shenyang government for 10 billion yuan ($1.55 billion), with the bank demanding that all proceeds go to settle debts with the lender, according to a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. The sale illustrates how authorities are taking steps to minimize fallout to the banking system from the worsening liquidity crisis at Evergrande as they try to avoid a bailout. Evergrande shares climbed 15% in Hong Kong, paring their year-to-date decline to about 80%. Evergrande boosted its stake in Shengjing Bank in 2019, following a request from authorities who wanted to recapitalize the lender, Bloomberg reported last year. Evergrande is facing mounting pressure to repay its debts. The developer needs to pay a $45.2 million coupon on Wednesday for a dollar bond that matures 2024, Bloomberg-compiled data show.</p>

            <p class="fs-3">SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — Just days after a South Dakota agency moved to deny her daughter’s application to become a certified real estate appraiser, Gov. Kristi Noem summoned to her office the state employee who ran the agency, the woman’s direct supervisor and the state labor secretary. A week after that, the labor secretary called the agency head, Sherry Bren, to demand her retirement, according to an age-discrimination complaint Bren filed against the department. “‘It’s clearly a conflict of interest and an abuse of power for the benefit of a family member.’” — Bren remembered it lasting close to an hour and including questions from Noem on how certification works. After consulting with her attorney, Bren declined to discuss with AP further meeting details, including whether Peters’s upgrade was discussed. “In the past week I was notified that my trainee, State Registered Appraiser Kassidy Peters, was denied upgrade of her license to State Certified Residential Appraiser,” Juelfs wrote. “ Juelfs’s letter blasted the application evaluation for lacking “timeliness and professionalism” and said the examiner reviewing Peters’s work had “acted unprofessional when conversing with Kassidy.” I’m glad I have it now and that I have the privilege to serve my clients in South Dakota.” “You also want to be fair and consistent and treat all your appraisers the same,” she said.

            <p class="fs-3">As Washington teeters closer to a possible government shutdown at midnight Thursday, here’s why the status of the nation’s debt ceiling may ignite more worry in financial markets. U.S. sovereign debt generally has been considered the safest and most liquid to own in the world, and all kinds of financial market products and processes have been pegged to the orderly functioning of the nearly $21 trillion Treasury market. “We do not believe and the market does not believe it’s a likely scenario,” said Rob Toomey, SIFMA managing director, capital markets and associate general counsel. “ But it would be a real problem scenario for the system generally and operations and settlement specifically.” If that happens, there would be a holder of record for the debt on the day before the maturity was scheduled, who would be entitled to get paid. Many analysts, including Moody’s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi, think it’s highly likely that a financial market freak-out — think of the day in 2008 when Congress initially failed to pass the Troubled Asset Relief Program legislation meant to address the financial crisis — would stop any of the scenarios SIFMA envisions before they happen, or a few minutes after midnight on the day they will.

Nevertheless, zoom out and the past year charts show strong growth, with all the main indexes still hovering near all-time highs. The question here is: is it wise to invest in names which have already accrued big share gains over the past year? Even better, all three are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. Salesforce’s cloud-based software products provide solutions for the customer-facing issues businesses face: tracking sales and commerce, managing databases, customer service, market analytics. The share gains reflect real-world success, as exhibited by the latest quarterly results for F2Q22. Story continues

“In-person conversations with new leadership give us confidence we could see a multi-year period of multiple and profit expansion tied to operating discipline and organic investments that can sustain growth... The new team, new model, and new post-COVID reality point to a structural change that could result in a material boost to profits as it scales revenue to $50B+… Both growth and margin expansion could become a more permanent and durable component of the CRM model going forward,” Bracelin opined. For 2Q21, the company posted clock adjusted earnings of $1.7 billion - or $1.27 per share, well ahead of the $1.10 consensus estimate and the company’s best performance since 2018. As such, Conoco remains one of our top picks.” In line with these comments, Freeman sets a Strong Buy rating on COP shares, with a $90 price target to suggest an upside of ~33% for the coming year.

Inflation is up, US job openings are exceeding the number of unemployed by record amount, and the pile-up of container ships on the West Coast is a continuing reminder that supply chains have not yet recovered from the pandemic disruptions. The ‘buying on dips’ psychology would certainly be tested under both scenarios.” The company’s ships can fill a wide range of roles. The tankers include chemical carriers of 17,000 dry weight tonnage (DWT), and oil carriers in the Suezmax and VLCC sizes, ranging from 150,000 to over 300,000 DWT. The new charters will add about $140 million to SFL’s contracted backlog. In a feature of interest to investors, SFL has paid out dividends reliably in every quarter since 2004. Jefferies analyst Randy Giveans sees a ‘base case’ scenario putting SFL in a sound position to maintain its strong share of the oceangoing carry trade as “Container trade grows by 5-6% during 2021 as markets begin to recover from the outbreak of COVID-19 [and] dry bulk shipping demand growth in 2021 grows by 4-5% on global economic recovery."

GS is not the only strong oil bull here. How to Play the Oil Price Rally

At this juncture, it's safe to say that Wall Street is decidedly bullish on the oil price outlook. Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta has recommended ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) as the best options to play the new gusher in oil prices. On COP:

"The company should deliver 30%-40% of cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends/buybacks, has proven a core competency around M&A execution, offers a better geographic diversification than many E&Ps [exploration and production companies], but higher oil leverage than the U.S. majors. We also see earnings beats continuing well into the future." Natural gas prices are up 125% in the year-to-date, while the biggest nat. The sticker shock is even greater in other key natural gas markets around the globe, with East Asian benchmark futures and European natural gas spot prices have climbed 4-5 times year-ago levels to $19 per MMBtu. International natural gas demand is booming. According to U.S. government statistics, natural gas inventories are currently 17% lower compared to a year ago and 7.4% below the five-year average. The latest data by the Energy Information Administration shows that nat. But that domestic stockpiling has been lower than normal, with producers exporting much of it as LNG. Asia and Europe still need to stock up more to prepare for the winter, and much of their supplies will have to come from the U.S. because non-U.S. LNG exporters have mostly been down with maintenance-related snags. Meanwhile, continuous unplanned outages at LNG export facilities in several countries, including Australia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Algeria, Norway, and Trinidad and Tobago, have contributed to increased demand for U.S. LNG.

            <p class="fs-3">(Bloomberg) -- If there's any country that might've been in a position to rescue Europe from its energy crisis, it’s the U.S. — home to vast shale fields holding a seemingly endless supply of natural gas and giant terminals capable of liquefying it and shuttling it abroad. Most Read from Bloomberg

Instead, for a multitude of reasons, U.S. shale is in no position to bail out Europe. Indeed, supplies are so tight that Americans are staring down their own supply squeeze — and the accompanying sky-high utility bills. Americans are likely to face some of their highest energy bills in years. U.S. gas output is only expected to rise by 1.1% during the second half of this year compared with the first six months, the Energy Information Administration said on Sept. 8.

That’s more than double the bank’s previous forecast. Then there are the temporal and physical barriers. “Gas producers looing at the strong forward curve really don’t have time to bring any new supplies online before the end of the winter,” said Jen Snyder, a managing director at research house Enverus.</p>

Home values and home equity have skyrocketed in the last year, according to a report from Unison. Here are several strategies for tapping your home’s equity. While the cash out refinance will produce a lump sum of tax-free cash, there are risks and drawbacks associated with this type of transaction. A reverse mortgage loan only needs to be repaid if you pass away or if your home is no longer your primary residence. By converting your primary residence into a cash-flowing rental property, you’ll hang on to the home and use the monthly rent to cover your mortgage payments. Knowing how much your benefits will be is vital to creating a plan that supports the lifestyle you want to live in retirement.</p>

Real-estate data company RealtyTrac reported that 48% of individual real-estate investors view the investment market as being worse or much worse than it was a year ago, based on the results of a survey the company conducted. Another issue that could be factoring into investors’ views on the state of the U.S. housing market is the situation with foreclosures. Investors remain divided as to whether they believe that foreclosure activity will return to normal in the future or surpass typical levels, the survey found.</p>

Declines in market value will produce mark-to-market losses that reduce earnings. Quoting his 2017 letter, he says that the rule produces "wild and capricious swings in our bottom line." Buffett insists that stock repurchases will be undertaken only if they can "buy at a discount to Berkshire's intrinsic value," since this way "continuing shareholders reap an increase in per-share intrinsic value with every repurchase by the company." New acquisitions and equity investments. " The federal deficit and the national debt. The magical metal was no match for American mettle," he adds. Investment fees and portfolio performance.

Meanwhile, free cash flow clocked in at multiyear high of $5.2 billion. “We are a year into executing bp's strategy to become an integrated energy company and are making good progress — delivering another quarter of strong performance while investing for the future in a disciplined way,” said CEO Bernard Looney.

Market makers will pay brokers a “make” fee for placing non-marketable limit orders, or orders that would be unprofitable to make at the time of the trade because of the current price of the underlying security. “After certain broker-dealers closed Gu and Lee’s accounts in early March 2021, Gu was able to continue the scheme through mid-April 2021 by lying to broker-deals about his trading strategy, using accounts in the names of other people, and accessing these accounts through virtual private networks to hide his activity,” according to an SEC press release announcing the charges.</p>

During her recent discussion of stock-market strategy on CNBC, Savita Subramanian, the head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America, said that small-cap stocks, especially energy and financial companies, were trading at compelling valuations and could give investors “more earnings yield for the same price.” So the banks now trade for 61% of the S&P 1500’s forward P/E valuation, while they have traded for 81% on average. A coming slowdown of bond purchases by the Federal Reserve is expected to push long-term interest rates higher, which for most banks will mean increased profitability, with wider spreads between rates on loans and those paid on deposits. A screen on ROCE can work well within an industry such as banking, because the banks are required to hold minimum levels of capital, including common equity, by regulators. This includes some companies that are investment banks and/or brokers. Schwab does so through its subsidiary, Charles Schwab Bank SSB.</p>
