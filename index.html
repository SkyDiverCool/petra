Economist Laurence Kotlikoff has spent the past 28 years urging most Americans to wait as long as possible to claim Social Security, which puts him in the crosshairs of those who think the government program will run out of money. Barron’s recently published an article in which Kotlikoff discussed his views on Social Security and many other topics. Clearly we were in a very risky position.” Other readers disagreed with Kotlikoff’s assertion that it makes sense for many people to take money from their individual retirement account to pay off housing debt in a time of record-low mortgage rates. Replied Kotlikoff this week: “The market has done well over the last decade or so. If stock prices were so safe, we wouldn’t see interest rates so low.” But not everyone has a 30-year holding period. “This is a safe, huge retirement that the government is offering,” he says. “ It’s like a bag of gold coins delivered to the front door.</p>

            <p class="fs-3">SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — Just days after a South Dakota agency moved to deny her daughter’s application to become a certified real estate appraiser, Gov. Kristi Noem summoned to her office the state employee who ran the agency, the woman’s direct supervisor and the state labor secretary. Still, government ethics experts who reviewed the series of events at the AP’s request said Noem’s decision to include her daughter in the meeting created a conflict of interest regardless of what was discussed. In September 2019, Peters applied to become a certified residential appraiser. However, Bren did confirm that at the meeting she was presented with a letter from Peters’ supervisor, Kristine Juelfs, who wrote that she disagreed with the denial and charged that Peters had run up against an “inefficient process.” This came as quite a shock to myself as she has represented the knowledge and skills necessary.” Bren declined to discuss the certification of any individual appraisers, including Peters. One day earlier, Hultman had called Bren to discuss “concerns about the Appraiser Certification Program,” according to Bren’s age discrimination complaint. From the archives (June 2021): Federal judge rebuffs South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s effort to force National Park Service to allow Mount Rushmore fireworks

Hultman told Bren that the phone call was to be kept a secret from her direct supervisor to make it appear Bren’s retirement was her choice, the complaint alleged. This sideshow regarding Kassidy Peters speaks for itself.” “Having more quality appraisers in the market will help keep our housing market moving and home prices down,” he said. I have been forced to retire by the Secretary of the Department of Labor and Regulation at the behest of the Administration,” she wrote, then added, “I want each of you to know that I have sincerely done everything possible to avoid this unfortunate circumstance.”</p>

            <p class="fs-3">As Washington teeters closer to a possible government shutdown at midnight Thursday, here’s why the status of the nation’s debt ceiling may ignite more worry in financial markets. “I see it as an exceedingly slim chance, although with all the theatrics, the possibility has been ramped up,” said Ben Koltun, director of research for D.C.-based Beacon Policy Advisors. “ The full faith and credit of the U.S. would no longer be full.” For one thing, it could bifurcate the market for Treasury bonds and bills into those that are clearing normally and those whose maturity dates are being massaged, SIFMA told MarketWatch. In a second scenario, which SIFMA said would be very remote, Treasury cannot, or does not, give any advance warning of a failure to make a payment, and it just happens. That would be far more chaotic, “a real problem scenario,” as SIFMA says. If that happens, there would be a holder of record for the debt on the day before the maturity was scheduled, who would be entitled to get paid. Many analysts, including Moody’s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi, think it’s highly likely that a financial market freak-out — think of the day in 2008 when Congress initially failed to pass the Troubled Asset Relief Program legislation meant to address the financial crisis — would stop any of the scenarios SIFMA envisions before they happen, or a few minutes after midnight on the day they will.

            <p class="fs-3">After a volatile period of reversals and re-reversals, the oil price rally is back with a bang as oil prices continue taking out multi-year highs. However, as with every other sector, there's a pretty big dichotomy in Wall Street regarding the oil price outlook, with both strongly bullish forecasts for even higher highs as well as strongly bearish views predicting a sharp oil price pullback. Story continues

GS is not the only strong oil bull here. BofA commodities strategist Francisco Blanch said he sees a case for $100 a barrel oil in 2022 as the world begins facing a serious oil supply crunch:

"First, there is plenty of pent up mobility demand after an 18 month lockdown. Third, judicial pressures are rising to limit carbon dioxide emissions. We therefore view the recent underperformance of cyclical segments as temporary." However, we argue a premium valuation is justified by a strong asset base and historical trading patterns.

Yet, some experts are saying that this rally is far from over. According to U.S. government statistics, natural gas inventories are currently 17% lower compared to a year ago and 7.4% below the five-year average. Indeed, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, domestic natural-gas consumption through June was in line with 2020 levels. Europe's natural gas spot prices have historically been lower than prices in Asia; however, this year, Europe's natural gas prices are tracking Asia's spot LNG prices more closely to attract flexible LNG supplies from around the world to refill storage inventories. A severe winter in the U.S. could lead to domestic markets having to compete with hungry Asian and European buyers, thus driving prices even higher. Widely regarded as a fracking pioneer and the king of unconventional drilling, Chesapeake Energy has been in dire straits after taking on too much debt and expanding too aggressively. CHK shares are up 40% since its March comeback. Mizuho has upgraded XEC to Buy from Neutral with a $95 price target, citing the company's "now-attractive free cash yield" following the recent weakness and payout capacity of its merger with Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG). "Balance sheets have improved significantly YTD, positioning the group for attractive cash return not only at $65/bbl but through the cycle, and we remain very constructive for that reason, with average upside 46% in our oil coverage," Mizuho's Vincent Lovaglio writes.

President Biden promised in his election campaign not to raise taxes on those making less than $400,000 a year (or $450,000 a year if married and filing a joint return). However, he adds, it looks like the law may also close some loopholes—inadvertently or not—for those who are on more middle-class incomes. There are two kinds of IRAs: traditional and Roth. In any year you hit those limits, you won’t be able to get any tax break on an IRA at all. You’ll be making too much to pay into a Roth IRA. And you will no longer have the third option, which is paying into a so-called “nondeductible traditional IRA,” an IRA with no tax break going in or coming out, and then immediately doing a Roth conversion — the so-called “backdoor Roth.” Should you rush and do that conversion while you still can?

            <p class="fs-3">(Bloomberg) -- If there's any country that might've been in a position to rescue Europe from its energy crisis, it’s the U.S. — home to vast shale fields holding a seemingly endless supply of natural gas and giant terminals capable of liquefying it and shuttling it abroad. The U.S. benchmark price jumped to a seven-year high this week, and it could more than double in the next few months, according to research firm BTU Analytics. Europe stands as example of what could unfold, with its disastrous supply shortage leading to record prices, widespread corporate failures in the U.K. power market and the continent’s biggest chemicals producer BASF SE cutting output as its feedstock costs soar. Shale-extraction techniques advanced in the two decades that followed, opening up vast new resources and transforming the U.S. into a global exporter. The residential, commercial and industrial sectors all will burn more gas this year than last, although overall demand may slip by 0.9% as soaring prices for the fuel prompt some electricity generators to switch to coal, according to the EIA. READ MORE: Europe’s Energy Crisis Is Coming for the Rest of the World, TooEven if an unexpected spell of mild weather frees up some U.S. supplies in coming months, gas exporters will almost certainly shun Europe and instead ship those cargoes to Asia where prices are higher, said Anna Mikulska, an energy-studies fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute of Public Policy in Houston. Then there are the temporal and physical barriers. And with domestic liquefaction plants that prepare gas for shipment overseas already running close to full capacity, there’s no room to export more fuel even if supplies were on hand, according to Rystad Energy Vice President of Markets Sindre Knutsson.

How to Convert Home Equity into Retirement Savings

Home values and home equity have skyrocketed in the last year, according to a report from Unison. Some retirees who downsize forgo buying a new home altogether, and opt to rent instead. While other types of refinancing can result in a lower interest rate or change the length of your mortgage, a cash out refinance leaves you with a new mortgage for an amount that exceeds what you currently owe. Reverse Mortgage

If you’re at least 62 years old, you may qualify for a reverse mortgage. If you own your home outright, you can take out a mortgage on the home and use the cash infusion to cover your retirement expenses, including a buying a smaller home or renting an apartment. Retirement Planning Tips

Social Security is an important piece of the retirement planning puzzle for many people. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard.

It has very large businesses across healthcare, including pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer health products. On 7/21/2021, Johnson & Johnson released second-quarter earnings results for the period ending 6/30/2021.

J&J is a Dividend King, and it has an excellent balance sheet to help maintain its dividend growth. 2: Home Depot (HD)

Dividend Yield: 1.98%

Percentage of the O'Shares US Quality Dividend ETF portfolio: 5.05%

Home Depot was founded in 1978, and since that time has grown into the leading home improvement retailer with almost 2,300 stores in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Comparable sales increased 4.5%, and 3.4% specifically in the U.S. Net earnings of $4.8 billion were up 11% from $4.3 billion, YoY. On a per diluted share basis, $4.53 for the second quarter increased 12.7% from the same period a year ago. See also: 4 ETFS for a Possiblity of a 7% Yield Portfolio

Home Depot has generated strong earnings growth in the past decade, as it has successfully capitalized on the housing and construction boom that ensued following the Great Recession of 2008-2010. E-commerce is another growth catalyst for Home Depot, as the company has invested heavily to expand its digital footprint.

The phrase “asleep at the wheel” could soon lose all meaning as Tesla and other automakers push self-driving cars closer to reality. Self-driving cars are on the horizon

We’re still years away from driverless cars speeding down the freeway, but simple automation is already present in many vehicles today. Level 5 vehicles (the asleep-at-the-wheel kind) could be commercially available by the end of the decade, says a report from the independent Victoria Transport Policy Institute. But they may not be affordable until the 2040s or 2050s. Other kinds of insurance will endure

Even if some forms of coverage do become obsolete, you may not be able to eliminate your auto insurance policy entirely. In most states, insurers are allowed to use your credit information to set your premiums, and they see people with high debt as risk takers. Finally, the best way to save on auto insurance is simply to shop around for a better price every so often.

A rebound in oil prices — and oil stocks — presents an unexpected opportunity for investors to collect some healthy dividend checks while fundamentals continue to improve. “We’re realizing significant benefits from an improved cost structure, solid operating performance and low-cost-of-supply investments that, together, are generating attractive returns and strong cash flow to fund our capital program, pay the dividend and reduce debt,” said Chairman and CEO Darren Woods. While the company hasn’t invested much capital in renewable sources of energy, Chevron’s significant position in the attractive Permian Basin and impressive free cash flow generation should give investors plenty of reasons to be bullish about. Chevron shares are also off 11% from their 52-week highs and currently provide a dividend yield of 5.3%, giving dividend value investors something to think about. In the most recent quarter, the company earned $2.8 billion while generating $5.4 billion in operating cash flow.

            <p class="fs-3">Stock futures pointed to a higher open Wednesday morning, recovering some of Tuesday's losses as Treasury yields pulled back from multi-month highs. The decline in technology stocks came as Treasury yields rapidly rose, with the swift move higher in borrowing costs pressuring valuations for growth and technology stocks. Some strategists suggested the latest move lower on Tuesday may not spark a deeper drawdown or formal correction in the very near-term. "It is really important that we separate the shutdown, which is terrible, from the debt limit, which is catastrophic," Jason Grumet, Bipartisan Policy Center president, told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. " "The government shutdown isn't really the problem we're grappling with," he added. " That did not make the sale for Republicans.

Like many stocks whose share price soared dramatically in 2020’s post-covid slump bull market, STKL stock has found 2021 more of a struggle, with shares down by 25% year-to-date. While revenue grew by 9.7% year-over-year to $202.27 million, in the process beating the estimates by $3.99 million, the company just missed on the bottom-line, as EPS of -$0.02 came in $0.02 shy of the Street’s forecast. Story continues

“With the stock now trading below $10, STKL is now valued at less than 15x EV/EBITDA on our revised estimates, which we believe is a bargain in plant-based food and beverage, where most companies are still unprofitable,” Fuhrman said. “ We expect consumer demand for plant-based products will continue to rise in the years to come, and demand for plant-based investments will remain strong as a result... What’s more, we believe there is an opportunity for demand in the food service channel to get even stronger as restaurants bounce back from COVID.” Shares are trading for $8.8 and have an average target price of $18.25, which suggests a bullish 107% upside potential.
