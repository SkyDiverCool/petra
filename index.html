Reuters revealed that wind power giant Iberdrola and solar project developer Prosolia Energy will jointly invest 850 million euros ($996 million) in five solar parks in Iberia by 2025, including one of Europe’s largest power plants in Portugal. Through the deal, the companies aim to develop total new capacity of 1.5 gigawatts (GW) in four photovoltaic parks in Spain and a mega-plant in Portugal, which is almost equal to the country’s entire current installed capacity, by 2025. Solar photovoltaic technology captures sunlight and turns it into electrical energy.</p>

India announced on Monday that it plans to resume exports of COVID-19 vaccines in the October quarter, prioritizing the global vaccine-sharing platform COVAX and neighboring countries first as supplies rise – a move that Reuters revealed last week. India, the world’s biggest maker of vaccines, stopped exports of COVID shots in April to focus on inoculating its own population as infections exploded. The country’s monthly vaccine output has since more than doubled and is set to quadruple to over 300 million doses next month.</p>

Writing to UK climate czar Alok Sharma ahead of the next round of global climate talks in Glasgow in November, the group said doing so was crucial to clarify the financial impact of climate change and give an incentive to invest accordingly.</p>

Reuters reported exclusively that a senior U.S. trade official privately criticized India’s July decision to ban Mastercard Inc from issuing new cards, calling it a “draconian” move that caused “panic.” U.S. government emails seen by Reuters showed frustration within the U.S. government after India’s central bank banned new card issuance by American Express and Diners Club International in April, then took similar action against it in July.</p>

Reuters reported exclusively that the Teamsters Union has launched campaigns to organize employees in at least nine Canadian facilities of U.S. e-commerce company Amazon.com. The campaigns could be seen as a bet by the influential union that success unionizing employees in a more labor-friendly market such as Canada will inspire similar results south of the border, where Amazon has so far fended off unionization attempts.</p>
