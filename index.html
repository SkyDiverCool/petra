            <p class="fs-3">On Wednesday, March 9, Amazon (AMZN) dropped a bombshell: For the first time since September 1999, the first time this century -- the first time this millennium -- Amazon will split its stock. As Horowitz observes, Wall Street analysts currently forecast only 12.5% revenue growth for Amazon's e-commerce business in 2022 -- but he thinks the company will grow retail revenues twice as fast, with help from "ongoing share gains in the massive grocery market."

Consumer prices rose 7.9% in February, as compared to the same month in 2021, according to data from the Labor Department released in January. Now, U.S. inflation is at a nearly 40-year-high. Here’s what Warren Buffett has said over the decades. The Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, during a 2015 shareholder meeting, noted that: “The best businesses during inflation are the businesses that you buy once and then you don’t have to keep making capital investments subsequently,” while you should avoid “any business with heavy capital investment.”</p>

If the free cash flow yield exceeds the current dividend yield, a company appears to have “headroom” for a higher dividend payout. For real estate investment trusts, we looked at funds from operations (FFO), which adds amortization and depreciation back to earnings and excludes gains on the sale of property.</p>

(Bloomberg) -- Even after one of the worst starts to an equity trading year in history, the market upheaval might just be getting started. Food prices are already past levels that contributed to uprisings in the past, and the outbreak of a war between Russia and Ukraine -- which combined account for 28% of global wheat exports and 16% of corn, according to UBS Global Wealth Management -- only adds to risks. But to keep a foothold in equity markets, it’s worth keeping an eye on purveyors of creature comforts and what people can’t do without such as must-have technologies, like Microsoft Corp.
