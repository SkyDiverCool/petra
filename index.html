Reininger said the company would benefit from the pending federal infrastructure bill, and is heading off some of the concerns that forced it to postpone a massive bond offering last year for the speculative venture. Such debt, which are meant for ventures for the public interest, is limited. It would take four years from construction to the first ride to Las Vegas, he said.</p>

Hecht continues to view FSK's current dividend yield as attractive and well covered, noting: "FSK currently trades at ~0.85x NAV and an 11.5%+ dividend yield, compared to a peer group that trades at 1.05x NAV and a 7.1% yield, while FSK is targeting a 9% annualized dividend yield on NAV, better than peer levels. At the same time, we highlight an asset sensitive balance sheet positioned to benefit if/when rates ultimately increase."

            <p class="fs-3">As Washington teeters closer to a possible government shutdown at midnight Thursday, here’s why the status of the nation’s debt ceiling may ignite more worry in financial markets. Still, after a couple of topsy-turvy years in which the previously unthinkable became real, some Washington and Wall Street professionals have been girding for a worst-case scenario. If it does happen, it turns a manufactured political crisis into an economic crisis. While most analysts expected a mid-October “X date,” when Treasury will run out of money to pay bills, Yellen on Tuesday told Congressional leaders that it would be Oct. 18. “ Beacon’s Koltun, among others, thinks markets will start to get antsy even earlier than that. Read: U.S. seen running out of cash between Oct. 15 and Nov. 4, as debt-limit drama continues

The very idea of a U.S. default remains so incongruous that the reaction in financial markets isn’t the only unknown. For now, there are two possible scenarios:

If the Treasury Department knows that it will miss a payment, it would ideally announce that at least a day in advance. That would allow the maturity dates of the bonds in question to be changed: a Monday maturity date would be changed to Tuesday, a Tuesday maturity would be changed to Wednesday, and so on. While that sounds relatively orderly, it still leaves many unknowns.</p>

            <p class="fs-3">(Bloomberg) -- If there's any country that might've been in a position to rescue Europe from its energy crisis, it’s the U.S. — home to vast shale fields holding a seemingly endless supply of natural gas and giant terminals capable of liquefying it and shuttling it abroad. Meanwhile, many major shale drillers have been funneling cash to shareholders and focusing on climate goals rather than boosting production. Americans are likely to face some of their highest energy bills in years. Makers of plastics, fertilizers and other gas-derived products seized on the flood of cheap, reliable shale gas, spending billions of dollars to build or expand manufacturing plants. Among U.S. shale executives, “there's been a dramatic shift in sentiment away from production growth and toward shareholder returns and ESG initiatives,'' Connor McLean, an analyst at BTU, said in an interview, referring to environmental, social and governance goals. Gas stored in underground U.S. salt caverns and depleted water aquifers — a crucial source of fuel to augment pipelined supplies during the peak demand of winter months — is 21% below the 10-year average for this time of year, according to research firm Vortexa Ltd. That helps explain why U.S. prices are surging. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gas for October delivery on Monday jumped 11% and topped $5.50 per million British thermal units for the first time since early 2014, when the Polar Vortex enveloped much of the U.S. in record-breaking cold. In California, which is dealing with a unique set of challenges that include a scarcity of hydro power and summer-driven demand for electricity to run air conditioners, prices already are surging.

While many big energy companies are steadily moving towards renewables, Exxon is committed to oil and gas, providing investors with a relatively pure way to jump into the space. In the most recent quarter, for instance, Exxon earned $4.7 billion in profits on revenue of $67.7 billion thanks to significant recovery in demand. While the company hasn’t invested much capital in renewable sources of energy, Chevron’s significant position in the attractive Permian Basin and impressive free cash flow generation should give investors plenty of reasons to be bullish about. Meanwhile, free cash flow clocked in at multiyear high of $5.2 billion. Chevron shares are also off 11% from their 52-week highs and currently provide a dividend yield of 5.3%, giving dividend value investors something to think about.

Yet, some experts are saying that this rally is far from over. The latest data by the Energy Information Administration shows that nat. Interestingly, the analysts note that U.S. consumption isn't really the driving force behind the strong price action. In the first half of the year, the U.S. exported roughly 10% of its natural gas, or 41% more than a year ago. Normally, excess natural gas produced during the summer would go into underground storage. For instance, Russia, Europe's most important natural-gas provider, has been slowing its deliveries. Europe's natural gas spot prices have historically been lower than prices in Asia; however, this year, Europe's natural gas prices are tracking Asia's spot LNG prices more closely to attract flexible LNG supplies from around the world to refill storage inventories. During times of falling crude prices, oil and gas producers normally use a short hedge to lock in oil prices if they believe prices are likely to go even lower in the future. For years, Chesapeake borrowed heavily to finance an aggressive expansion of its shale projects. Thankfully, Chesapeake successfully emerged from bankruptcy this year with the ongoing commodity rally offering the company a major lifeline. CHK shares are up 40% since its March comeback.</p>

But disbursing them could run into delays. Much like Social Security, it’s possible. Senate Republicans, though, are strongly opposing the plan.

Shares of Moderna are down by 7% today as higher Treasury yields put significant pressure on high-growth stocks. Recent comments from CEOs of Moderna and Pfizer, who stated that life may get back to normal in a year, may have put some additional pressure on the stock, although it looks that current weakness is mostly related to the sell-off in riskier assets which was triggered by higher Treasury yields.

            <p class="fs-3">And yet after nearly 50 years, there’s plenty that the 47.9 million households that use IRAs to save for retirement still get wrong about these retirement accounts. Experts also say account owners also forget whether their contribution is taxdeductible. Traditional IRA: Known as a traditional individual retirement account, it allows people to direct portions of their pretax income toward investments that can grow tax-deferred. Sax Pilvinis also notes account owners are not always aware that an IRA is a tax status and not an investment vehicle. Many account owners mistakenly think their heirs will inherit their IRA by stating those wishes in their will. Now, those who inherit an IRA have just 10 years to distribute all the assets in the account. And because of that, says Bajalia, “IRAs are now tax time bombs to their beneficiaries because of the loss of the stretch IRA.” “In actuality, beneficiaries other than spouses can only do direct transfers, which is called ‘trustee-to-trustee transfers,’ ”, says Ian Berger, an IRA analyst with Ed Slott & Co.

If an inherited IRA is paid to a non-spouse, the entire IRA will be taxable to the beneficiary, he notes. “ However, protection from non-bankruptcy judgments depends on state law. This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Retirement: 5 things people get wrong about IRAs</p>

Stock moves after the deal was announced turned that premium into a discount. Still, Newmont Corp.’s takeover of Goldcorp Inc. in 2019 generated about a 17% premium, while Kirkland’s purchase of Detour Gold Corp. later that year came in with about a 24% premium. Agnico had been shied away from large deals in the past, but this deal is “more about a number of mines and location of mines in terms of manageability, rather than an overall ounce number,” Boyd said.

            <p class="fs-3">Couple discusses cost basis with their financial advisor

Sometimes an inheritance includes more than a house or an heirloom vase. Determining the value of such a bequest is vital. Without the proper calculations or procedures, you could face hefty tax consequences. Consider working with a financial advisor on estate planning challenges, such as how to value things you inherit. In this case, it’s the purchase price of an asset like a stock and it’s adjusted for anything that impacted the value, i.e., dividends, commissions, fees or gains. This perk is known as the stepped-up basis loophole. Whether you inherited the stocks through a brokerage, will or trust, calculating the cost-basis stays the same. However, only the amount that goes over the minimum will actually face the tax. But as long as the estate’s overall value sits below limits, the heir won’t face taxes as part of the inheritance. Other Tax Considerations on Inherited Stocks

You might not have to go looking for the cost basis of the inherited stock. Also, some states require heirs to submit a tax waiver for their inherited accounts. The Takeaway
